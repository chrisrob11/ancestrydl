## Acknowledgments & Attribution

This project builds upon the pioneering work of other developers who have reverse-engineered Ancestry.com's internal APIs:

- **[cdhorn/ancestry-tools](https://github.com/cdhorn/ancestry-tools)** - Python tools for extracting and refactoring GEDCOM files with media. Provided insights into media API endpoints and GEDCOM processing.
- **[neRok00/ancestry-image-downloader](https://github.com/neRok00/ancestry-image-downloader)** - Script for downloading images from Ancestry trees. Documented the approach for querying the media API to obtain authorized download links.

Thank you to these developers for documenting their findings and sharing their knowledge with the community.
